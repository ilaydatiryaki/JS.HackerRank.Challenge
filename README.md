# JS.HackerRank.Challenge

###### Arithmetic Operators

#### Objective

In this challenge, we practice using arithmetic operators. Check out the attached tutorial for resources.

#### Task

Complete the following functions in the editor below:

1. getArea(length, width): Calculate and return the area of a rectangle having sides length and width.
2. getPerimeter(length, width): Calculate and return the perimeter of a rectangle having sides length and width.

The values returned by these functions are printed to stdout by locked stub code in the editor.

#### Input Format

getArea

1. Data      Type    	Parameter	Description
   Number	   length	  A number denoting the length of a rectangle.
   Number	   height	  A number denoting the height of a rectangle.
  
getPerimeter(length, height)

2. Data     Type	  Parameter	Description
   Number	  length	A number denoting the length of a rectangle.
   Number	  height	A number denoting the height of a rectangle.
   
#### Constraints

* 1 <= length,width <= 100
* length and height are scaled to at most three decimal places.

#### Output Format

Function   	  Return Type	   Description
getArea     	Number	       The area of a rectangle having sides length and width.
getPerimeter	Number	       The perimeter of a rectangle having sides length and width.

## Sample Input 0

3
4.5

## Sample Output 0

13.5
15

## Explanation
The area of the rectangle is length X width = 3 X 4.5 = 13.5.

The perimeter of the rectangle is 2 X (length + height) = 2 X (3 + 4.5) = 15.
